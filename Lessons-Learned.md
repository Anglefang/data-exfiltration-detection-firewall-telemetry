# Lessons Learned:
- Single compromised device can cripple an entire network
- Cloud services (SharePoint) are common exfil channels
- Attackers will pivot to alternate protocols when blocked
- Firewall telemetry alone is enough to detect large-scale exfil
- Bandwidth anomalies are strong early-warning indicators
- Escalation must be enforced early when persistence is observed
